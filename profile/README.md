## 🔧 Featured Projects
* Works In process *
### **Unity WebGL Build Pipeline**
Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build and deploy Unity WebGL projects.  
Supports both single-repo GitHub Pages publishing and cross-repo deployment patterns used in classroom environments.

### **Python Log Analyzer**
A practical Python utility for parsing logs, detecting error patterns, generating summaries, and supporting real-world troubleshooting workflows.

### **Playwright / Selenium Test Automation Demo**
A clean, modern testing example demonstrating automated smoke tests, page checks, screenshots, and CI integration using GitHub Actions.

### **Internal Tools & Scripting**
Automation utilities for file organization, cleanup workflows, and operational scripting—representative of internal tooling and systems-support engineering.

### **Unity Mini-Project (WebGL)**
A small Unity WebGL demo used as a testbed for build pipelines, GitHub Actions workflows, and lightweight gameplay scripting.

## 🛠 Engineering Practices & Workflow Design

In addition to the code, many Gallant Labs repositories demonstrate strong **developer-workflow and GitHub process design**, including:

### **✔ Custom GitHub Issue Forms (YAML)**
Structured, reusable forms that support clear communication and consistent task management:

- **Bug Reports**  
- **Feature Requests**  
- **Task / To-Do items**  
- **User Story Task breakdowns**  
- **Instructor Feedback / Rubric form** (used in classroom workflows)

These templates enable scalable, repeatable reporting patterns — valuable for QA, internal tooling, classroom project tracking, and lightweight Agile practices.

### **✔ CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions)**
- Automated Unity WebGL builds  
- Static hosting deployment (GitHub Pages)  
- Multi-repo / private→public deployment patterns  
- Test automation pipelines  

### **✔ Documentation & Developer Enablement**
- Clear READMEs and architecture docs  
- Classroom-friendly workflows  
- Onboarding guides and structured examples
